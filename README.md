# Surgery Armor Fix

Fixes surgery failures sometimes not applying damage due to apparel.

## Description

RW 1.0 made it so injuries sustained during surgery don't bypass armor, leading to strange situations where patients can escape even disastrously-botched surgeries unscathed, as long as they're wearing high-quality armor. This mod fixes that, by setting these injuries to Surgical Cut, a damage type that was used in earlier versions to avoid this exact problem.

Can be added or removed to existing saves. Place anywhere in your load order.
