# Surgery Armor Fix

For some unknown reason, version 1.0 of RimWorld made it so injuries sustained during surgery don't bypass armor, leading to strange situations where patients can escape even disastrously-botched surgeries unscathed, as long as they're wearing high-quality armor. This mod fixes that, by setting these injuries to Surgical Cut, a damage type that was used in earlier versions to avoid this exact problem.
